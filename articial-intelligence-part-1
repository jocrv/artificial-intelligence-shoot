The following definitions represent, respectively, the search methods:

1) Initially, the method expands the root node, generating all its children. If one of these children is the solution to the problem, the method stops. Otherwise, one of them is chosen, according to some criteria, to be expanded and its children are tested again. The process continues until a solution is found or until a selected node can no longer be expanded. The solution is reached (if it exists), but it cannot be guaranteed to be the best one.

2) From the root node, operators are applied successively, according to the defined strategy, until the solution is found or until the method can no longer continue. It does not guarantee that the solution to the problem will be found.

3) Expands the nodes in the order they are generated so that nodes of a certain level are only generated and evaluated if nodes of the previous level have already been addressed. It evaluates all branches of the tree, therefore, in addition to guaranteeing the determination of the problem solution (if it exists), it guarantees that the solution is optimal.

Regarding Genetic Algorithms, we can say that:

III - The choice of the initial population, for genetic algorithms, must be judicious, generating only individuals with a high degree of aptitude and not admitting any degree of randomness.
